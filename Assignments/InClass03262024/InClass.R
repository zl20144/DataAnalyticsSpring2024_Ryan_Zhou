# We first briefly examine the data. We notice that the variables have vastly different means.
# Note that the apply() function allows us to apply a function—in this case, the mean() function
# to each row or column of the data set.
# The second input here denotes whether we wish to compute the mean of the rows, 1, or the columns, 2.
# We see that there are on average three times as many rapes as murders,
#and more than eight times as many assaults as rapes.

# We can also examine the variances of the four variables using the apply()
function.

# We now perform principal components analysis using the prcomp() function, which is one of several functions in R that perform PCA.
# By default, the prcomp() function centers the variables to have mean zero. By using the option scale=TRUE,
# we scale the variables to have standard deviation one.
# The output from prcomp() contains a number of useful quantities.

# The rotation matrix provides the principal component loadings; each column of pr.out$rotation contains
# the corresponding principal component loading vector
# We see that there are four distinct principal components.
pr.out$rotation
# Using the prcomp() function, we do not need to explicitly multiply the data by
# the principal component loading vectors in order to obtain the principal component score vectors.
# Rather the 50 × 4 matrix x has as its columns the principal component score vectors.
# That is, the kth column is the kth principal component score vector.
dim(pr.out$x)
# We can plot the first two principal components as follows:
biplot(pr.out, scale=0)
# The scale=0 argument to biplot() ensures that the arrows are scaled to represent the loadings;
# other values for scale give slightly different biplots with different interpretations.
# The prcomp() function also outputs the standard deviation of each principal component.
# For instance, on the USArrests data set, we can access these standard deviations as follows:
pr.out$sdev
# The variance explained by each principal component is obtained by squaring these:
pr.var = pr.out$sdev^2
pr.var
# To compute the propotion of variance explained by each principal component, we simply
# divide the variance explained by each principal component by the total variance explained
# by all four principal components.
